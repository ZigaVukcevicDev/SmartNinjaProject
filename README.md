# SmartNinjaProject
SmartNinja repo for the eshop part of the AngularJS course.

## Folder structure
Each lesson is stored in a separate folder and has it's own gulpfile as well as it's own dependencies. Just navigate to a lesson and do `bower install` and `npm install`. 

Just run `gulp watch` and go to `localhost:48080/dist` and you'll see the running app.

Have fun.
